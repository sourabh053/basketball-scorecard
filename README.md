# BasketBall Scorecard Site

I made this site when i started learning with [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/#overview). It is very good plateform to learn HTML/CSS and JS for the beginners. It has inbuilt code editor means when you are watching a video you can pause it at any time and start coding on the same editor on which your mentor from scrimba is coding.

## Overview

This site i have made using HTML/CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. Its basically a score manager site for basket ball and looks similar to real life basketball Scorecard. when a team is winning its name is highlighted. A new game can be started when u press new game button, both team scores will then go to zero.
